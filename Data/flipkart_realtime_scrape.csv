I am impressed by the polycarbonate build of the iPhone 5c, which is excellent to hold and very sturdy. No squeaky noises that comes from many plastic shelled smartphones as such. I recently bought this from a local store as the particular seller cannot deliver the item to my pin code. I was using an iPhone 4 for a long time but it started to die on me, so had to make a choice between Nexus 5 and iPhone 5c. Nexus was pure android and I wanted to shift this time but the battery reviews made ... Just Bought This From Flipkart.

I purchased this phone from Flipkart on 19 Sep 2014After about 15-20 days of use , I can give following reviews about the iphone.....Awesome budget iphone by apple. If u don't care much about the metal body of apple and have a limited budget, this phone is perfect for you. People asked me to compare 5C with nexus 5 , HTC desire 816 , xperia T2 ultra, MOTO X But believe me an iPhone is an iphone u cannot its features with same features in other phone.Although being a smartphone, it has a ... The Iphone 5C was my first Iphone and frankly with the larger screen its really worthwhile now. Lack of bluetooth file transfer and inability to make 3G Video calls pinches a lot. Video calling over facetime thru internet is provided over wifi. It also says thru mobile network but yet to try. However, its interface is as as smooth as hot knife in a butter brick.Maps, Whatsapp, FB etc are really very smooth. Transferring your own song library to the devise thru itunes takes a lot of techni... Still using it in 2019  I did not buy this from flipkart. I got this on exchange for a 2-yr old iphone 4 from an apple authorized retailer.Pros- 1) Seems faster and quite natural with iOS 7. (Had used a iphone 4 earlier)2) Slim and Sleek and the steel-reinforced casing definitely converges with the overall design. Doesn't feel/look like even a bit of lumia. Once you hold it, you will know what I mean.3) Back casing (some steel reinforced mix) is quite strong contrary to my expectations and it's scratch resistan... 1) Plastic Case: - Many influencing people criticized Apple for launching a Plastic Case for 5C. The prime reason for Apples launching a plastic case was to give a customer variety of colour choices like that of an iPod which was not possible to be executed on a metal case. Apple saved a lot of money on manufacturing cost with the launch of plastic 5C model, the benefits of which are not yet passed on to the customers. But even if Apple has launched a plastic case for 5C that does not mean yo...",https://flipkart.com/apple-iphone-5c-green-8-gb/p/itmffg4gdds5tf7d?pid=MOBDWXZT5BP6KZNW&lid=LSTMOBDWXZT5BP6KZNWWWKYUC&marketplace=FLIPKART&q=Iphone&store=tyy%2F4io&srno=s_1_17&otracker=search&otracker1=search&fm=organic&iid=1e810824-eb08-4e8c-929b-bf2eeffc122f.MOBDWXZT5BP6KZNW.SEARCH&ppt=None&ppn=None&ssid=pulutlcxmo0000001749322937415&qH=29e0a89b3149a9af

I am a big guy with big hands so buying a super sized smartphone was a no brainer for me. Hence, it goes without saying that I have been an Android user since stone age! I won't go into the usual boring stuffs of megapixels, ppi, number of cores, how much ram or that age old battle of iOS vs Android.

First things first - the delivery was prompt and it was from AAA deals (had opted for in-a-day delivery). The phone is very sleek and thin - might need a case if you have slippery hands. The build quality is excellent. Below review is from my own experience of switching from Galaxy S3 to this iphone 6+. The cons: 1. The phone is big - if you have small hands/prefer smaller phones in general, this is not for you (especially existing iphone users - consider iphone 6 maybe). Existing Galaxy/N... I am using this phone from last 2years and four months, found no issues. Battery back is very good. Finally - This is definitely an awesome phone.
